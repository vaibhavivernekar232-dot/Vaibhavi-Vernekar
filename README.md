## 🧩 Dashboard Module (src/dashboard)

The dashboard package is intentionally separated into layers:

* analytics.py: KPI calculations and aggregations (no Streamlit code)
* charts.py: Plotly chart builders with shared theming
* insights.py: Short narrative insights derived from chart data
* exports.py: CSV, Excel, and PDF export helpers
* dashboard_page.py: Streamlit UI with filters, KPIs, charts, and tables

---

## 🧪 Multi-Tier Extraction Strategy

OCR is probabilistic. This system reduces failure risk using layered extraction.

* Tier 1: Gemini AI structured JSON extraction
* Tier 2: Regex fallback for missing fields
* Tier 3: spaCy NER vendor detection (ORG entities)
* Tier 4: Vendor template parsing (when a template exists)

---

## 🧩 Template-Based Parsing

Vendor templates live under [src/extraction/templates/](src/extraction/templates/) and are applied when
fallback is triggered and a vendor match exists.

Template schema:

```json
{
      "vendor_key": "VENDORKEY",
      "aliases": ["VENDOR NAME", "VENDOR-ALIAS"],
      "static_fields": {
            "vendor_name": "VENDOR NAME"
      },
      "fields": {
            "invoice_number": { "patterns": ["regex", "regex"] },
            "purchase_date": { "patterns": ["regex", "regex"] },
            "purchase_time": { "patterns": ["regex"] },
            "subtotal": { "label_patterns": ["regex_label"] },
            "tax_amount": { "label_patterns": ["regex_label"] },
            "total_amount": { "label_patterns": ["regex_label"] }
      },
      "line_items": {
            "start_markers": ["regex_label"],
            "end_markers": ["regex_label"],
            "line_pattern": "regex_with_named_groups"
      }
}
```

Notes:

- `vendor_key` is the canonical key for a template.
- `aliases` are matched after normalization (uppercased, non-alphanumerics removed).
- `patterns` extract the first capture group match from OCR text.
- `label_patterns` extract a numeric amount that follows a label.
- `line_pattern` should include named groups like `item_name`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `item_total`.

## 💱 Currency Handling

* Supports INR, USD, EUR, GBP, MYR (extensible)
* Converts analytics to USD
* Preserves original currency, original amount, and exchange rate

---

## ✅ Validation Strategy

* Amount validation accepts tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive totals within tolerance (±0.02)
* Hard duplicates are blocked, soft duplicates are warned

---

## 🔐 Security and Stability

* File size and PDF page limits enforced
* SHA-256 file hashing
* Parameterized SQLite queries
* Defensive JSON parsing
* API keys never stored in the database
* Graceful error handling across layers

---
